Wes Bos: Oh, welcome to syntax and this Monday hasty treat, we're gonna be talking about tips to succeed on YouTube. Now, you may not have aspirations of being a huge youtuber or anything like that. But it is a great way to not only improve your skills to get better at teaching and to understand your own code better. Because once you learn how to explain your stuff, in a different way to a global audience, it really changes how you think about your code. And now my name is Scott Dylan scheme with me as always is West boss. Hello, everybody. Hey, Wes. This episode is sponsored by Freshbooks, which is one of our longtime sponsors here over at syntax. So with a little bit more about Freshbooks as West boss. Yeah, so Freshbooks is cloud accounting, or as they say, small business accounting software that makes billing painless. If you are a small business, or freelancer, or just somebody who needs to send out a couple invoices per year, and keep track of them for tax time and keep track of who's paid and who hasn't paid. You need to check out fresh books. So I really like fresh books, because tax time is coming up in probably about a month right now. And right now I'm just kind of getting all of my expenses in order I'm following up on unpaid invoices, all that good stuff. And it's super easy to do because of the dashboard that Freshbooks provides you so if you want to check out fresh books, go to freshbooks.com for syntax and use the syntax in the How did you hear about a section that's gonna get you a 30 day unrestricted free trial? Thanks so much to Freshbooks for sponsoring. Nice. Yeah, so today we're talking about YouTube. But Scott and I are both fairly active on YouTube. Scott, probably, I would say you owe a lot of your career to YouTube, Would you say that's fair? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, at least that my current career because the game does something I like anticipated. When I started my career was just sort of started out of for funsies, you could say, and then it led to a lot of opportunities. And I just saw how much it enhanced my career overall. So I absolutely the amount of success that I found on YouTube has certainly changed the trajectory of my career forever. Definitely. Yeah, stay with me, I've had been probably uploading videos for nine years to YouTube. And I don't do it with any sort of consistency. But I have quite a bit of stuff up there. And it's always interesting to look back and see what videos got really, really popular in the Flexbox ones I kind of owe for kicking off my sort of course career because before I did my Flexbox course, I had my sublime course, but kind of at the same time, I was just uploading a couple just random videos on Flexbox to YouTube. And they did extremely well. And people started emailing me like where are the rest? Where are the rest? And I thought, okay, okay, I need to like appealed it back and started from fresh and did like a full blown course and put that up on YouTube and has done super well. So I owe a lot to YouTube as well. I think it's it's really, really interesting. I love YouTube. As a consumer, I love to watch stuff on YouTube. Anytime I need to learn something, I'll go up on YouTube. And I love it as a professional. Anytime I want to be able to show something, I'll throw it up on YouTube as well. So we're gonna go through, like, I'm not sure how many tips we have here. But a whole handful of tips for making sure that you get the most bang for your buck when you do because making a video is a lot of work, right. And if you want to post it, you should get the the views and the eyeballs that you're hoping for. Yeah, eyeballs. That's what we're all after. So, first and foremost, I do want to note that like, I think people have a misconstrued view of how much money you can make on YouTube. Now YouTube has paid by rent for a little while now. And that's pretty much what it's going to do for you, you know, even at you know, nearly 300,000 subscribers, it's gonna make you money for rent, it's not going to make you superduper rich that's necessarily in this space. If you're getting into the millions of views, millions of followers on every video kind of thing, then it's gonna be a little bit different of a story. But I think people see some of the big time YouTubers and think that everyone on YouTube who has a decent following is making a ton of cash. And that's certainly not the case. So just setting your expectations in terms of like what it can do for you financially is good to get out of the gate. That way you're not disappointed when you find out you're not making a ton of money. After all this effort you're putting in at the end of the day, the money isn't necessarily the best things that I've gotten out of YouTube, best things I've gotten out of YouTube are job interviews, jobs and, and opportunities that have completely changed my career. Not not the money from the advertisements.

3
00:04:49,050 --> 00:09:32,850
Yeah, I've run the numbers on it and I think that I get about $3 CPM. I know that YouTube is anywhere from $1 50 to $5. CPM and CPM is Cost per mille, which is Latin for cost per 1000 views. And obviously, that number goes up and down. Depending on how long your video is, if you have ads inserted in the middle of it, you can do sponsorship deals and stuff like that. But somebody with a $3 CPM, and you get a million views, they're probably making anywhere between 1000 and $5,000. On that some industries, like people who do YouTube videos on like personal finance, and like credit card reviews get like like $20 per 1000 views, because it's such a high, it's kind of like AdWords used to be. Those are like very niche topics that people want to get in front of. Whereas like somebody like streaming their twitch set up, it probably won't get that high, because it's mostly just kids watching that don't have much money to spend on things. Right. Right. Yeah, so it definitely does vary quite a bit. And the algorithm, let me tell you, YouTube can change that algorithm at any point, one time, it was like a couple years ago, YouTube changed their algorithm in one day, in my revenue, I kid you not, I saw it from one day to the next viewership hadn't changed. My algorithm or my income went cut in half, so that people who are doing things correctly are making money off of YouTube via sponsorships via about products via other things. So if you have success on YouTube, you should try to translate that elsewhere. Not just try to harness that on YouTube, because again, it's not going to make you a ton of money. So let's get started with some of these tips here in terms of how to get your content seen. And the big thing that works and works consistently. Besides spamming it to Reddit or something like that is S e. o on YouTube, you want to make sure that all of your videos are optimized to show up in YouTube's next watched or recommended videos or anything like that, that way, when somebody is watching some content for something that your video might pop up there as being the thing that they should watch next. And that to me has always been the biggest driver of people to my content is Seo because there's a ton of people searching for things on YouTube. The very first thing I do when I want to learn something on YouTube, is I head to YouTube, and I search for it. And then I look for the ones with some various qualities, which we'll get into as well. So again, SEO is king. And I think the most important thing about SEO on YouTube is having a good title. Now titles need to be descriptive, they should be talking about what the video is showing exactly. And it should not be deceptive, right, you shouldn't have a title that does not describe your video content. The most important thing for me in terms of deciding a good title for a video, as far as SEO goes, is to think about what a user who doesn't know what they're looking for might search for when they're searching for your video. So a bad example might be a video named react set state, right? Somebody who doesn't know about what the set state syntax is, might not search for set state, they might be searching how to use state in react or something like that. So you want to have your idea of what exactly people might be looking for in these video titles. Again, eye catching is good misleading is bad. Yeah, there's no quicker way to get thumbs down on a video than having a clickbait title like that. I also like Scott has these videos called what is blah, blah, blah, like what is graph QL. And I see that those do do really well for you it just because it's it's a great title. I've got some of my own, I do the here's how blah, blah, blah, works, they do a little bit better than some of my other videos that specific, like, let's look at some of my like worst videos right here. The repeat function in CSS Grid, right? Like that's got very low views, because people aren't necessarily looking for something like that. But they they may be looking for something like how to have a large grid or something like that, right? You have to think about what is in the actual content before just like writing the actual API's because people aren't necessarily if they knew what the API was, then they wouldn't be searching for it. Right? Yeah, right, exactly. And that's the context. You always have to frame when you're thinking about this stuff. Next up, we have description is important. So when you when you were talking about SEO, it's important to also like stuff keywords, not necessarily like, intentionally, but when you're writing the description of your video, use whatever it is that you like, take some time to figure out what's in your video and put that into text. Because that is going to a help people figure out if the video is 10 minutes long, they're going to read the description to see does this actually cover what they want? as well as it's going to do really well for SEO people searching Google's people searching on YouTube, that's going to help you out a lot.

4
00:09:33,050 --> 00:13:25,830
Yeah, I make sure the first two sentences really describe what the video is doing in a way that is both searchable and practical for the user, aka This video shows you how to use state in react so that we can build a to do list blah, blah, blah, right? It's a one sentence and then it tells the user what they're going to be doing. It also has some keywords in there. So things that people might be searching for. And again, the reason why I say the first two sentences that little bit is important because everything else gets hidden. Behind a little see more tag, right? People do not click that see more, unless they've already enjoyed the video unless they've already decided they're going to watch it. So if you are having stuff in that description that is important below the sea more, no one's gonna see it unless they've already determined that they like your content. So keep the important stuff at the very top, don't throw your sponsor links at the very top, that's a quick way to get people upset. So in addition to having that first couple sentences being important, you can have SEO or SEO fluff below that and make sure that all of your sponsored links are listed as sponsored links as an ad, these are advertisements, right? You don't want to have like a link that says, I don't know, it's misleading your users to go off site to go do something that they're going to have to pay for when it's maybe a referral link or anything like that. So you want to make sure that stuff is clearly listed as sponsored YouTube is in their terms of service now that you need to do that. So do it. Next up here, we have use tags. And when I say use tags, I mean all of them, you do have a limit in terms of how many tags you should have on a video. And if you do not have that limit on every single one of your videos filled with tags to that limit, you are not doing things right. And I don't mean billing your your video was the perfect list tags that are you know, not what the video is like, if it's a video on react, don't put an Angular tag on it, right? hoping that you're going to get some of that sweet Angular audience, no, that's not going to happen, you're just wasting a tag there. So make sure that you use these tags. And one of the things I do is I use an extension and a product called Tube Buddy, which suggests a bunch of related tags. And I rely on this thing. It makes it super duper easy to come up with tags, it scans your sort of video and the description and the related tags. And it suggests a bunch of stuff for you. So instead of having to come up with this stuff yourself, you can just click, click, click, click, add these tags in there and make sure they're all relevant. Next tip we have here is schedule your content. And this is probably good for any type of content that I think the reason why this podcast just does so well is that we schedule it every single Monday and Wednesday. People know to expect it. This is not something I do just I don't have that volume of YouTube videos coming out. But I do watch a lot of people who I know there's this one YouTube channel or watch called mousetrap Mondays, and every single Monday, he tests out a new type of mousetrap, which is so dumb, I don't care about that. But I love watching them. And I know that every single Monday, there's going to be a new one out there. So if you can sort of like much ahead of time, like what I'll do when I when I released my free courses, I will schedule them every single Monday, Wednesday, Thursday. And that will just start to get people in the rhythm of knowing when your new content is going to come out. Yeah, when I built my channel, I had strict Monday, Wednesday, Friday releases, and people knew that they could always check back now since I haven't been doing a ton of that scheduling, but I plan on doing it more my what is Wednesday thing was really good for a little while, and then I sort of fell off with it. So I'll plan on bringing the what is Wednesdays back definitely this year. And it's also worth trying your videos out at different times of the day in different days. Because you might think like, oh, Monday morning is the best time to post a video but like my wife posts, YouTube videos, and the best time for her to post a video is on Sunday afternoon, which seems like the worst possible time but it's the best for her because that's when the type of person who watches her channel has a little bit of free time and wants to sit down and watch a little bit of YouTube. Absolutely.

5
00:13:25,949 --> 00:17:27,240
Next is going to be keeping viewers because well you get people to watch your video. That is a good way to get a view on a video. But it's not a good way to get a view on 10 videos. The best way to get a view on 10 videos is to have them stick around and smash that subscribe button so hard that they break their trackpad. So keeping viewers is extremely important. And the number one thing that gets me to stick around a YouTube video or YouTube channel is quality. If I go to a YouTube channel, the video quality is on point the audio quality is on point the examples and maybe the if they're showing code the code is large enough to see and everything is like that. That is the quickest way for me to click subscribe. The quickest way for me to leave and never ever come back is using your computer's microphone could also be just typing into a text editor instead of talking into a microphone. These are all all reasons why I would banish your channel from my life forever. And another would be you know, pissing off your audience with clickbait. Don't use clickbait strategies I get you know a lot of people can't see through that stuff. But I think that people who are valuable viewers, they can see through clickbait stuff they can tell when you're just trying to get people to trick them into watching your videos. So stay away from that stuff always be providing value. Those are awesome. I don't even have anything else to add to that next little ones I found that I see people using more recently. So a lot of these tricks that we have for making a our YouTube channel, people start to use them, they work really well, then the rest of the world catches on and then they stop working as well, or YouTube changes the algorithm. Like the tagging thing. I don't find the tagging works as well, it still works for sure. But I don't think it works as well anymore. There's other tricks that sort of come around. It's not a golden ticket or something. No, no, totally. So the other things I see people doing right now is pending comments. So I think a lot of people now instinctively skip over the video description, and go immediately for whatever the comments saying. So if you can write yourself a comment or have somebody else who hasn't written a nice or helpful comment, you can pin that to the top that will really help along the same lines as that is liking other people's comments. YouTube will now show your avatar as hearted beside comments, and it will push those to the top. And what I found people are using these for is keeping the trolls at bay. So if you like 20 of the top comments, what happens is that you don't all sudden have these like snarky trolls, who are just there to like, say first or something that is mean. Yeah, because you scroll, scroll, scroll or whatever. I can only see the the nice comments I'll give up. Yeah, right. Well, and speaking of keeping the trolls at bay, I delete that stuff. You know, I delete the trolls. If somebody's spamming, if somebody says, Well, this video is great. If you like this, you should check out my video on this. No, you get banned for forever from my channel for that, because because that's why not. That's why people like people aren't looking at the comments to hear arguments, they're not looking at the comments to see somebody saying first or for advertising yourself. They're there in case there's an issue with the code. Or maybe they have questions, or maybe they ran into a problem, and they're trying to get past it. And those are the comments that are useful. So I have no problem banning or deleting comments that do not fit that people are dropping f bombs in my comments. Like, listen, this is an educational channel, I want kids to be able to watch this stuff like I have no problem deleting that stuff. Next one we have here is this is just a tip in general, I think, and I see it in a lot of people who have YouTube channels that are fairly new, and it's not being able to finish a thought or finish a sentence. You see this in public speaking as well, where people sort of end their sentence with sentences with end. Yeah. And yeah, or knowing where to take a thought and to end it and just stop talking is a skill. I think that a lot of people can improve upon.

6
00:17:27,320 --> 00:22:07,500
Yeah, and edit your stuff. I mean, edit that stuff out. Yeah, that, you know, don't leave that stuff in there. Next is going to be collab when you can, this is a good one for growing your audience. You know, one of the things when I had been doing my channel for a little while, and those of you who have been a fans of different YouTube channels by remember, Dev tips for designers with Travis and Travis and I started chatting A while ago about this stuff. And we ended up interviewing each other for each other's channels. Then we did some joint videos where we talked about different topics that were sort of, you know, blog II sort of podcasting like things where we were, you know, even just hanging out or talking about different Dev and design stuff. And we would publish on one or the other's channel and more recently, Travis released a video tutorial series on level up tutorials. So being able to collaborate with other YouTubers, especially ones that have decent sized audiences is a big thing. Now, if you are a YouTuber with five subscribers, and you go to a YouTuber with 500,000 subscribers, they're going to say no, so find other people who are in your realm or just a little bit, right, if you have 10,000 subscribers, maybe find someone with 20,000 subscribers, or even go big 550 thousand subscribers or something like that. So don't go too big, keep it in your zone, and collaborate, it's going to give you some practice. And by the time you're building up, and you want to go ahead and get those big fish and collaborate with them, then they're going to see your qualities high, you work with people really well and they're going to want to collaborate with you. Finally we have here is just use all the features that YouTube has to offer. So YouTube has cards and they switch us up quite a bit. So sometimes if you It's annoying, watch it. If you watch like a older YouTube video, people are like, just click here. Yeah, point into like a blank spot. And there's like nothing there. So YouTube has cards and things that can be overlaid. They have this new YouTube premiere, where you can watch a video with the author and it streams live. I watched one of those but I found myself frustrated because I like to watch videos that to x. And I was like this is this is real life. It's too slow for me. So maybe I just need to start it in half an hour later. playlists are very helpful I find so every time you have a video, pop it in a playlist, spend some time curating your your page so that if someone says Hmm, I'm new to this channel, there's 400 videos in here. What should I watch, and if they click through to your channel, you can show the different sort of like I have a JavaScript one I have a CSS Grid one, a whole bunch of different playlists that And that will also help your recommendations as well. Yeah, absolutely. You know, I definitely I take advantage of this kind of stuff, I use playlist really heavily to organize my content. And then I have all my playlist on the front page. Again, at one time, I was really, really intense about setting up my YouTube channel. And since I've died off on it is a little bit, but I use these things definitely. And YouTube is always coming out with cool stuff in terms of like, even the pending comments is pretty new in the scheme of things. So use the features that they give you, because they give them to you for a reason. And definitely take advantage of all that stuff. Again, your channel can get as big as you want, if you are willing to put the time and effort into it, if you're not willing to do that, it's probably just going to, it's going to probably stay small. And that's cool. And I think the last note I have on here is don't get sucked into the BS of YouTube, right? So many people, they're trying to be other people on YouTube, they're trying to do what other people are doing. And they're not trying to be themselves. They're trying to use clickbait everywhere. They're trying to just sucker you in with low quality. But using like tricks, if you feel like you're having to trick people to watch your stuff, it's probably not a good route to be in. Again, you don't have to follow any of this stuff. You can say Screw it, I just want to do this. And then when I started my YouTube channel, the whole goal was to provide documentation for things that did not have documentation. And that was it. I only implemented some of these strategies after I was trying to make more money on youtube and do things like that, again, you do not have to follow any of this stuff. Do you? Do you? And I think that is going to really just improve your enjoyment on this kind of platform. Absolutely. I agree. So hopefully, those are some tips for your YouTube channel. If you have a YouTube channel that you'd like us to check out tweet ads, syntax FM, and we're retweeted a couple of them because it's kind of interesting to see what what type of stuff that people are working on. Because I often find that some of the best videos that I find only have, I don't know, 1000 views on them. And I think wow, this content is is high quality it should it should be surfaced much more

7
00:22:07,530 --> 00:23:12,180
Yeah, you know, it's extra funny, you say that I was on a, I was on a fitness Reddit and there was like a video about bent over rows. And somebody was saying, like, I'm doing my bent over rows, which is an exercise, we lift the barbell up to your chest, I'm doing those wrong, and I can't figure it out. And then somebody said, oh, here's a video giving you like eight easier ways that activate the same muscles, but are like less difficult to mess up the form. And I clicked the video and I watched it and it was so effective and so good. I click subscribe immediately. And then your I noticed after I click Subscribe, that channel had two subscribers to subscribers and they had like 20 plus videos. And I was like, This is bananas. How does it How does nobody find this stuff? So definitely we want to share some of this this Good, good content. So pass your good stuff along. We want to you know, help you out if you are making good stuff and people aren't seeing it. Awesome. Anything else to add? I got nothing. Awesome. Cool. Well, thanks for tuning in. Hopefully you enjoyed that and we will catch you on Wednesday, who is
