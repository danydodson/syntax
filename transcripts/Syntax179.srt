00:00:27,420 --> 00:04:42,480
Wes Bos: Welcome to syntax in this Monday hasty treat, we're going to be playing a TLD game, which I am so excited about. Wes has a little story about this game, so I'm gonna let him introduce the game. But before we get into that this episode is sponsored by Log Rocket. Now Log Rocket is a longtime sponsors syntax, one of the coolest services in the universe, I was gonna say on the planet, but considering it's a rocket ship, it's most likely outside of the planet. Log Rocket is a error tracking and handling service that allows you to see the errors as your users have seen them. It is awesome. What you do is you get a session replay video of the error that's happening. As the user saw, let's say they click on this icon of a maybe a winking emoji or something mean that Winky emoji breaks the whole site, you can see exactly what they clicked the error log, the Network tab, the Redux store, all that stuff that you want to know, to figure out what happened when you solved the to solve your bugs. So if you want to check out Log Rocket, head on over to Log rocket.com for slash syntax, and you're going to get 14 days for free, one of those services, you really have to, I should say C to believe because it's a visual thing. But it's just that cool. So check it out Log rocket.com forward slash syntax. All right. My name is Scott to Lenski. And with me, as always, is Wes Bos. And, Wes, you have a little bit of story about this game. So I'm interested to hear this little intro. Yeah, I was out for drinks with a bunch of creatives, I guess, some photographers and whatnot. And we're just kind of standing around talking about how I make websites and domain names. And then I somehow I brought up that I own bo bosta af. And I was telling them how how much of a pain in the butt it is because it's Afghanistan. And there's like a sanction in the US against doing business with Afghanistan businesses, so you can't get CloudFlare for it. And there's all these, these things that can happen with it. And I was saying like how it was, like 100 bucks a year to register this thing. And it's funny, but it's also a pain. And he's like, oh, man didn't even know AF was a thing. Like, that's Afghanistan. And he's like, Man, you must know so much about domain names. And I was like, I do know so much about domain names. Like, it would be fun to do a, like a little game where kind of like stumped, where we go back and forth. And we have a list of every single TLD a TLD is a top level domain so.com dotnet, dot onion dot actually done, you know, I think is actually one that's not a, that's just if you're actually using Tor. Yeah, but there's hundreds and hundreds of them here. And some of them are associated with businesses, some of them are not registerable. Some of them are associated with countries. So what we're gonna do is Scott will pick a TLD. And then we have to answer the question. Is it for a country or a business? And so yeah, we have to say that, if so, what country is it for? Or what business is it for? Or what type of business is it for? So like, if you look at something like doc accountant, right, that's obviously not for a specific business, but it is for the type of business that is an accountant. How much per year does it cost? So you either have to guess how much it is per year? Or you can say unregistered because there is some that are unregistered. And because they're just there, they're owned by companies like companies can go ahead and pay to get their own TLD like dot blog is owned by WordPress. But WordPress does allow it does sell it whereas they could just keep it for themselves if they wanted. And then finally the last question is is Scott dot whatever? TLD and West dot TLD available. So it's got dot blog available and is West dot blog available? So we have to take yes, those. Do you have any idea like points scoring for this? I was maybe thinking about doing like a golf thing, like lowest score wins. So every time you get one, right, just to make it more. And then if you guess like how much per year if you are off however many dollars you're off. That's how many points that you have to add to your score. And

3
00:04:42,890 --> 00:04:43,800
Unknown: my God.

4
00:04:44,910 --> 00:05:50,190
Wes Bos: put a lot of thought into this over the weekend. I'm so excited about it. I'm excited. I think that all sounds fun. And you know what, this doesn't have to be the only time we play this game. So let's say we run with these rules and they're no good. We can always change it. We can tweak it. Yeah Yeah, there's no rules. This is our podcast. We do what we want. Yeah, I'm wearing an overalls t shirt right now to remember those. No rules. No rules. No. What's, what's that from? What is that? It's a brand. I think I remember that. We had a when I was a kid, we had extreme zone, which was like the Sears like streetwear brand. And I loved having everything extreme zone. And we used to go to this like outlet mall in Canada that had like a Sears outlet, and I would buy all buy up all the extreme zone gear and just rock it so hard. That's amazing. All right. So first TLD is dot B. Oh, oh, that'd be Oh, okay. So first question. Is it a country or a business?

5
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:55,650
Unknown: Is it a country or a business? I'm gonna say it is a country. You are right.

Yeah, that's what you mean. Like, it's it's obviously a business registered that so they could make money selling baby? Oh, I see what you're saying. Yes. Yeah. Okay. Yes, it is a business. Okay, and what type of business? Or is it? Is that an actual business? I'm gonna say it's just a type of business. So for baby related businesses. I'm trying to find out to be honest, let me see. Here it says if you go to one one domain.com Ford slash baby dot htm it says the purpose of baby dot baby domain name extension is to create online space where people can connect to a worldwide network of parents as well as goods and services aimed at parents. Hmm. So you're wrong. So you know, I said it's for I said, it's for baby related businesses. Okay, that's not the right parents. You miss the P word. The parent the parent. Babies can't use the internet, I guess. Okay, so you are sitting pretty at negative 20 points so far. How much does it cost per year? Two register, dot baby. I'm gonna say 20 bucks. You're wrong. It's 80 bucks. Oh, that's a

61

63
00:12:59,490 --> 00:13:32,310
Wes Bos: Oh man, you're catching up late Well, now it really is West West that baby and Scott baby available? I would say both are available. They are both available. You know what I should when I tested this domain? I should have checked if I should have done the pricing based on Scott that baby I did the pricing based on West baby and the price he for some reason West baby 80 bucks. What about Scott that baby 300 bucks that would have put me in first place.

64
00:13:35,160 --> 00:13:35,670
Unknown: Oh,

65
00:13:36,150 --> 00:13:41,100

101
00:20:14,300 --> 00:20:19,820
I think you are officially the winner, but it ended up being much closer than I got

102
00:20:19,820 --> 00:20:55,440
Wes Bos: 120 Oh, wait, no, hold on. We got Scott. I am we got the last question to answer here. One Two. Well, yeah, you still gotta guess. Yeah, yeah, I know. I know. But you still Yeah, because God I am. is available in West I am is available, I'm guessing. Okay. Uh, Scott that I am is not available. And it doesn't matter. Either way.

104
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:08,760
Wes Bos: If you didn't botch that first one. It would you would have just decimated me.

105
00:21:08,939 --> 00:21:14,520
Unknown: Yeah. is all about what was the win the first one I don't even remember what it was. Oh, I got the country right to Oh, my gosh,

106
00:21:14,600 --> 00:21:32,160
Wes Bos: yeah. You killed that with the country. Bolivia, add that to the soundboard. Bolivia. All right. Well, I know if you found that entertaining. I certainly did. I think we should do that again. Because there's literally thousands of other.

00:21:32,759 --> 00:21:40,290
Unknown: There's so many. When I looked at this list, I was like, Oh, my gosh, there's just more than you can possibly even parse. So

108
00:21:40,310 --> 00:22:34,590
Wes Bos: yeah. Because like, a couple years ago, they opened it up where you could like put in a application for a space. I think it was still like $100,000 to get a TLD. And I'm not sure what the the costs are to maintain that. But there you can get like there's New Holland. Oh, that's a good one. Is that the popular brewery in Michigan? Or is it the tractor dealer? Do this live? We should do a live PLD game with the audio. Yeah. But like, I have it like timed countdown. So you can Yeah, and we should be able to look at like a list of countries as well. I think that'd be kind of interesting. I don't know. Yeah, I think we just we just discovered something. All right. Well, that's it for this hasty treat.
